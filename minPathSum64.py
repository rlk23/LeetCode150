'''
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200

    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])


        dp = [[float("inf")] * (cols +1) for r in range(rows+1)]

        dp[rows-1][cols] = 0
        print(dp)

        for r in range(rows-1,-1,-1):
            for c in range(cols-1,-1,-1):
                
                dp[r][c] = grid[r][c] + min(dp[r+1][c], dp[r][c+1])

        return dp[0][0]
